# VEHICLE LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION USING PYTHON AND OPEN CV

The overall aim of this project is to develop car license plate recognition system that able to detect and recognize car plates from visual sources using Digital signal processing and free and open source technologies like Python and OpenCV . The accuracy depends on the clarity of image, orientation, light exposure etc. To get better results we can try implementing Machine learning algorithms. Most of the times of the image quality and orientation is correct, the program was able to identify the license plate and read the number from it.
